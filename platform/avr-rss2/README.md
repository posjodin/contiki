Getting Started with Contiki using avr-rss2
===========================================

Document version
----------------
V1.2 2019-04-25

This guide's aim is to help you start using Contiki for RSS2 boards
The platform supports different AtMega-RF boards:

* Based on MCU AtMega256RFR2 (Current. Rev2.3 and Rev2.4)
* Based on MCU AtMega128RFR2
* Based on MCU AtMega128RFA1 

Boards all looks the same. AtMega256RFR2 boards are labeled with "Made in EU".
The platform and CPU code, are common for both boards, can be found under 
`$(CONTIKI)/platfrom/avr-rssa`. The port was developed and tested with RSS2.
This guide assumes that you have basic understanding of how to use the 
command line and perform basic admin tasks on UNIX family OSs. You should
also have understanding about the Contiki OS design as well have C 
programming skills.

Board Features
---------------
* Chip Antenna. Supercardiod.
* Robust radio performance. Up to 300 meter line-of-sight.
* Unique EUI64 address via chip combined with EEPROM
* Rev 2.3 Onboard temp sensor DS18B20,
* Rev 2.4 Onboard BME280 Temp/RH/Pressure
* Light Sensor.
* 32kHz RTC clock xtal
* Comparator chip and input. 
* Progammable power FET, (relay) for power on/off of sensors.
* DC input via LDO up to 25V.
* Standard. 6-pin TTL-USB header for FTDI cable for USART.
* PCB formfactor for cheap project box G.40X IP54
* Power/current use:
  * RX ~10mA (Full RPC AtMegaXXRFR2). 
  * Sleep ~45uA @ 16MHz XTAL
  * Sleep ~15uA @  8MHz using internal oscillator
* Preprogammed Atmel standard bootloader. 
* CE certified by test institute.

USART 
-----
The board has one USART via the 6-pin TTL-USB adapter, The default
baudrate is 38400 bps. This speed gives the lowest error with respect 
of the used clock frequency used internally. It's possible to use higher
speeds as is 250k and 500k baud which gives 0% Error with 16MHz clock. 
(An addtional USART is on the chip but as default used by interrupt pins)

Contiki Port Features
---------------------
The platform has the following key features:
* Standard, E64 address from built-in chip. Chip also has a 128bit ID.
* Support for Atmel RPC (Reduced Power Consumption) for AtMegaXXXRFR2. 
* Stable port since many years.

Toolchain
---------
The Atmel toolcahin is available in most operating systems. 
For a full toolchain and easy installation on Ubuntu:

apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude

Toolchain alternative I
-----------------------
Otherwise if OS toolchain packages do not support the AtMega256RfR2
MCU, another option is to download the C compiler toolchain from
Microchip.

### For Linux and MacOS

1. Download the proper 8-bit C compiler AVR toolchain, 32 or 64-bit,
   [from Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/avr-and-arm-toolchains-c-compilers).
2. Unpack under `/usr/local`.
3. Add to your search PATH. For example add to `.bashrc`: `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/avr8-gnu-toolchain-linux_x86_64/bin` (for 64-bit systems) or `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/avr8-gnu-toolchain-linux_x86/bin` (for 32-bit systems).
4. For flash programming, you need `avrdude`. On Ubuntu Linux, it can be installed with the command
`apt-get install avrdude`. For MacOS, there is a [HomeBrew
package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/avrdude#default) that can be
installed with the command `brew install avrdude`. (You first need to
[install HomeBrew](https://brew.sh).)

Toolchain alternative II
------------------------
You might also consider Instant Contiki.


Toolchain Windows
-----------------
Goes here


Contiki platform
-----------------
avr-rss2


Contiki build TARGET
--------------------
    make TARGET=avr-rss2

For older AtMega128RFR2 boards:

make TARGET=avr-rss2 MCU=atmega128rfr2

For older AtMega128RFA1 boards:

make TARGET=avr-rss2 MCU=atmega128rfa1


Flashing/Programming hardware
------------------------------
Programming using avrdude using serial bootloader. (TTL-USB cable)
Press the RESET button. The bootloader with wait for boot commands 
for 3 seconds.

Flashing commnad line example 256k MCU:
    avrdude -p m256rfr2 -c stk500v2 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 -e -U flash:w:hello-world.avr-rss2 

Note! Older bootloader needs 38400 (Yellow LED)

Flashing older 128k MCU:
    avrdude -p m128rfa1 -c avr109 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 38400 -e -U flash:w:hello-world.avr-rss2 


Example of tested applications
------------------------------
* `examples/hello-world`
* `examples/rime`
* `examples/ipv6/multicast`
* `examples/example-shell`
* `examples/powertrace`
* `examples/sensniff`
* `examples/ipv6/rpl-udp`
* `examples/ipv6/simple-udp-rpl`
* `examples/ipv6/rpl-tsch`

* `examples/avr-rss2/timer-test`
* `examples/avr-rss2/hello-sensors`
* `examples/avr-rss2/tsch`
* `examples/avr-rss2/ipv6/tsch-udp`
* `examples/avr-rss2/ipv6/rpl-border-router`
* `examples/avr-rss2/ipv6/rpl-udp-report`
* `examples/avr-rss2/ipv6/coap-publisher`


Note that the shell example needs file `symbols.c` to be added to project also seems like
in `core/dev/serial-line.c` the function `process_poll` must be replaced with `process_post`:

     /* Wake up consumer process */
    -  process_poll(&serial_line_process);
    +  process_post(&serial_line_process, 0, 0);
